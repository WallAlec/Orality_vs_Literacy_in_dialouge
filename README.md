# Orality vs Literacy in Dialouge

I wanted to see what features separate oral versus literary dialogue, and can we use these features to accurately classify between these two types of dialogue? What are the implications of these differences? Could we observe a change over time in the relationship between spoken and written language? Specifically, from a humanistic perspective, what may the relationship between spoken and written language and/or how it has evolved over time imply about orality and literacy culture?
