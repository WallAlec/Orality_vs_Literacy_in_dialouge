# Analyzing the Characteristics of Spoken and Written Language: A Computational Approach
A project helping detect differnece in spoken and written language. 

Orality vs Literacy. I wanted to see what features separate oral versus literary dialogue, and can we use these features to accurately classify between these two types of dialogue? What are the implications of these differences? Could we observe a change over time in the relationship between spoken and written language? Specifically, from a humanistic perspective, what may the relationship between spoken and written language and/or how it has evolved over time imply about orality and literacy culture?
